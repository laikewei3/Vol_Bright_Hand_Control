# Vol_Bright_Hand_Control
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand movements and gestures for controlling volume and brightness settings on a computer. The project uses OpenCV and a custom hand tracking module to detect hand landmarks and calculate the appropriate movements. The volume control is achieved using the pycaw library to interact with the Windows audio endpoint API, while screen brightness is adjusted using the screen_brightness_control library. Overall, this project provides an intuitive and interactive way to control computer settings using hand gestures.
